<p>Let's start simple.  I have one javascript demo here.  It is a sound canvas that reflects the amplitude of the
sound over a short interval of time.  Leave it running and it paints a picture based on the sounds picked up by
your microphone.  It does require you to provide permission to the page to allow the use of the microphone.
It doesn't record anything.  The sound is only analyzed for volume in a sense.  Go play with it and have fun.</p>
