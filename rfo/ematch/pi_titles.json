The fact that voltage triggers the key protein-protein interactions between DHPR (on the cell surface) and RyR (intracellular) channels represents a significant technical barrier to their study outside the cell. The capture and characterization of static and voltage-driven transient protein-protein interactions between DHPR and RyR will require expansion of the genetic code in muscle and, concomitantly, expansion of the experimental arsenal for the study of muscle biology.  Our long-term goal is to apply advances in the burgeoning field of chemical biology to testing the long-standing hypothesis that voltage-driven protein-protein (mechanical) coupling between DHPR and RyR facilitates rapid release of Ca2+ from the internal stores. The objective of the proposed research is to apply an innovative chemical biology approach - the incorporation of a genetically encoded synthetic amino acid benzophenone-Phe (Bpa) with a unique photoactivated crosslinking activity into designer DHPR's - in the environment of skeletal muscle, using it to covalently trap otherwise elusive, transient protein complexes. Several key innovations make our study feasible: the use of retro- and adenovirus to express the orthogonal tRNA and Bpa synthetase genes; large-scale preparations involving esterfication strategies used previously to generate Fluo-AM dyes to produce a form of Bpa that is highly soluble, non-toxic and biosynthetically competent for genetic incorporation into muscle; and, while not the subject of our present objective, we show proof-of-principle Bpa incorporation into related vol The goal of this request is to simply continue the progress towards the goals of my NIH funded study through the purchase of essential equipment.

PDE6s&#x0D;\nserve as key effector enzymes in the vertebrate visual transduction cascade. The&#x0D;\nphototransduction cascades in rods and cones are principally similar, and the main rod&#x0D;\nand cone signaling molecules are highly homologous. In contrast, the physiology of rods&#x0D;\nand cones is markedly dissimilar, most notably with respect to sensitivity, response&#x0D;\nkinetics, and adaptational range. These differences are fundamental to the ability of the&#x0D;\ndual photoreceptor visual system to operate within a wide range of light intensities, yet&#x0D;\nthey are poorly understood. Elucidating the molecular origins of the differences in&#x0D;\nphysiology of rods and cones is a major current task in the phototransduction field. We&#x0D;\nhypothesize that distinct rod and cone PDE6 provide an important contribution into&#x0D;\ndissimilar physiology of rods and cones. The first main goal of the proposed research is&#x0D;\nto test this hypothesis with the use of a novel and robust transgenic mouse model&#x0D;\nexpressing cone PDE6C instead of functional PDEAB in rods.

Mutations in PDE6 are known to cause&#x0D;\nretinitis pigmentosa (RP) and achromatopsia in humans.

A remarkable level of understanding has been achieved in the field on the mechanisms of transducin in the phototransduction cascade. The current focus of our research is on the mechanisms of transducin trafficking and transducin-dependent modulation of photoreceptor responses beyond phototransduction. Very little is known about transport of transducin from the inner segment (IS) to the outer segment (OS). Uncoordinated 119 protein (UNC119) has emerged as a major factor facilitating the ISOS transport of transducin- (Gt). We propose to investigate the structure and properties of the trafficking complex between Gt and UNC119 by Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) and X-ray crystallography. Based on the preliminary SAXS analysis, we hypothesize that a novel interface between UNC119 and Gt is essential to the UNC119-induced dissociation of Gt subunits and protein solubilization from the membrane. The interface and the proposed model of Gt solubilization by UNC119 will be probed with mutational analysis. Solubilization of Gt from IS membranes with the formation of the Gt-UNC119 complex is the initial step in the ISOS transport of Gt, which terminates with the cargo release into the OS. A small ARF-like 3 GTPase, ARL3, will be investigated as a putative release factor in Gt trafficking. We hypothesize that Gt is released from the complex with UNC119 by a mechanism involving ARL3-induced conformational changes both within and outside the acyl-binding cavity of UNC119 and will test this mechanism. Defects in protein transport are a common cause of photoreceptor degeneration. Elucidation of molecular details of transducin trafficking will significantly contribute to the understanding of transport of peripheral membrane proteins in photoreceptors and will have important implications for retinal diseases.Finally, we will investigate a novel conce"},

{"contact_pi":"Blumberg, Mark", "college":"Liberal Arts and Sciences", "pi_titles":"Behavioral State Development in Infants State-Dependent Sensory Processing across Early Development", "pi_summaries":"Sleep occupies one-third of our adult lives and yet its function is still not known. In infants, sleep is even more prominent, as are the spontaneous myoclonic twitches that are a defining feature of active (or REM) sleep. Over the past decade, research in the PI?s laboratory has helped dispel the notion - which held sway until recently - that the brain plays no role in the control of infant sleep. Moreover, it is now widely accepted that sensory feedback (i.e., reafference) from twitching is closely monitored at all levels of the neuraxis. Of particular importance for this proposal is the recent discovery of oscillatory events?called spindle-bursts (SBs)?that are produced in primary sensory cortices in response to endogenously and exogenously generated sensory stimulation. It is thought that twitching, its associated reafference, and cortical SBs participate together in the development and maintenance of topographic organization. The PI?s laboratory has been engaged in this effort by monitoring neurophysiological activity in unanesthetized newborn rats as they cycle spontaneously between sleep and wakefulness and respond to specific peripheral tactile and proprioceptive stimulation. This proposal addresses two broad aims. First, a transient period during the first postnatal week in rats has been discovered when corpus callosotomy disinhibits spontaneous cortical activity and when recovery of function after callosotomy is possible. It is hypothesized that sleep-related twitching contributes to this recovery of function, just as it contributes to normal development. To test this hypothesis, neurophysiological and neuropharmacological approaches will be used, including the novel application of amperometry to unanesthetized infant rats for the measurement of real-time extracellular changes in cortical choline, glutamate, and GABA levels in relation to behavioral state, myoclonic twitching, and peripheral stimulation. Second, recent work suggests that SBs are differenti Every animal must distinguish sensations arising from its own movements from those arising from stimuli in the external world (e.g., lifting your arm vs. having your arm lifted for you). This distinction between self- and other produced&#x0D;\nmovements requires precise self-monitoring. Self-monitoring is instantiated mechanistically by copies of motor commands-corollary discharges-that prepare the nervous system for the arrival of sensations triggered by self-produced movements. Corollary discharge signals can gate, cancel, or otherwise modify incoming sensory signals. We propose to investigate two novel aspects of corollary discharge: Its expression in&#x0D;\nearly infancy and its modulation by sleep-wake state. One impetus for this proposal is the observation that, in newborn rats, sensory feedback from self-produced limb twitches during active (or REM) sleep triggers spindle bursts in sensorimotor cortex and increased Purkinje cell activity in cerebellar cortex. In contrast, during wakefulness when vigorous, self-produced limb movements typically occur, cortical spindle bursts are surprisingly absent and Purkinje cells are largely silent. This paradoxical \"masking\" of neural activity during&#x0D;\nwake suggests the novel hypothesis that corollary discharge mechanisms are regulated in a state-dependent fashion. Importantly, the hundreds of thousands of twitches produced by infant rats each day during sleep trigger substantial brain activity that is thought to promote activity-dependent development in the sensorimotor system."},

While many hearing aid (HA) and cochlear implant (CI) users enjoy fairly accurate speech perception in quiet, they often experience difficulties when listening to more spectrally complex stimuli, such as music, a pervasive and culturally significant art form, and speech in background noise. These limitations are likely related to the signal processing of CIs as well as limitations in the central auditory pathways, particularly in pediatric populations with congenital hearing loss. Through investigation of complex acoustic signals at the auditory periphery, and the coding of those stimuli within the central auditory nervous system, we will deepen our understanding of why music and speech perception in noise is so challenging for hearing impaired listeners. In this study, we will investigate characteristics of the listener's auditory system, the acoustic signal input, as well as potential benefit of music training in relation to perception of spectrally complex sounds (music and speech in background noise).

Our research team has reported that CF pigs spontaneously develop CF sinusitis, the first animal model with this phenotype. Our objective in this application is to determine key factors that CFTR regulates in sinonasal immunity in a novel CF porcine model. Our central hypothesis is that in the CF porcine sinus: 1. HCO3- secretion is defective, 2. Airway surface liquid (ASL) pH is decreased, and 3. Bacterial killing is impaired. Our rationale for these studies is that the identification of treatments for CF sinusitis in the CF pig model will help establish a strong scientific framework for eventual clinical trials in humans. Our goal is to identify the contribution of CFTR to sinus development in a novel cystic fibrosis (CF) knockout pig model with the newborn phenotype of sinus hypoplasia, decreased sinus branching, and aberrant cartilage development. People with CF have sinus hypoplasia and craniofacial changes, yet the mechanism is not completely understood. We have developed an innovative approach to test the role of CFTR in luminal fluid secretion and sinus epithelial morphogenesis with a novel 3-dimensional sinus organoid culture that recapitulates early sinus development. We will also utilize an innovative approach to identify the mechanism of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in CF using RNA-Seq to profile the transcriptome of the craniofacial tissues of the pig, and gene ontology analysis to identify signaling pathways important in craniofacial development. We believe that the research proposed is innovative and represents a significant departure from the status quo because of: 1) the discovery that CFTR is important for craniofacial sinus development independent of infection and inflammation 2) the innovative approach in the study of sinus morphogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and 3) the use of the CF pig model to investigate pathogenesis of aberrant craniofacial sinus development."},

Proton transfers are challenging to understand and control because they can involve quantum tunneling of the proton, solvent control of the reaction coordinate, and strong anharmonic couplings of the proton to many degrees of freedom of the complex. Given the importance of proton-transfer reactions and the difficulties associated with accurate modeling of their chemical dynamics, there is a critical need for a ground-electronic-state, experimental, model system in which the kinetics and dynamics of the proton transfer can be measured directly. The objective of this application is to develop such a model system and to use that system to test theoretical predictions about the factors that control the reaction dynamics. This work will yield insights into proton-transfer reaction dynamics that will improve the models that scientists use to think about these reactions and how to control them. To achieve the objective of this proposal the PI will pursue the following three specific goals:&#x0D;\n1.\tDevelop a model system for studying the kinetics of proton-transfer reactions. Our preliminary data suggest that complexes of deuterated formic acid with tertiary amines have the necessary spectroscopic and chemical properties to access the proton-transfer reaction kinetics via 2D IR chemical-exchange measurements.&#x0D;\n2.\tDetermine the factors that control the kinetic properties of the model proton-transfer system. Our working hypothesis is that measurements of the primary kinetic isotope effect, the temperature dependence of the rate and the isotope effect, and the variation of the rate with the solvent properties will reveal the factors that control the proton-transfer reaction dynamics and will serve as a benchmark for computational methods.&#x0D;\n3.\tUnderstand the effect of vibrational excitation on the proton-transfer equilibrium.

{"contact_pi":"Christensen, Gary", "college":"Engineering", "pi_titles":"Consistent Anatomy Registration for Lung Cancer Adaptive Radiation Therapy", "pi_summaries":"Adaptive radiotherapy has the potential to enable substantial dose escalation to lung tumors by controlling for geometric variation in the anatomy during the treatment course. Two key requirements for adaptive radiotherapy are (i) the ability to measure the current location of targets and critical structures from an image acquired during treatment, and (ii) the ability to estimate the cumulative dose delivered up to the current treatment fraction. Image registration can be used to accomplish both tasks, registering an image acquired during treatment to the original planning image. For lung tumors, particularly non-small cell lung cancer,geometric variation during the treatment course is primarily non-rigid. Changes in the target shape and volume potentially in response to treatment, shifts in the location of the gross and clinical targets relative to bony anatomy, changes in lung volume and respiration-induced motion, and displacement between primary tumor&#x0D;\nand lymph node targets, all represent such non-rigid variation.  Deformable image registration (DIR) is therefore an appropriate choice to measure tissue locations and map&#x0D;\ncorresponding tissue day to day under such conditions. However, DIR algorithms used conventionally in radiotherapy have been designed to measure true deformation (i.e., elastic reconfiguration of tissue positions)&#x0D;\nrather than pathological changes such as tumor regression or growth (i.e., removal or addition of tissue). In fact, some evidence exists that the boundary of the gross tumor regresses in relation to adjacent normal tissue&#x0D;\nsuch as pulmonary vessels and bronchioles. Conventional DIR algorithms, whether intensity-driven or segmentation-driven, tend to align corresponding high-contrast edges in the images, and therefore will attempt to align the macroscopic tumor boundary. In this case, such a registration may incorrectly align tissue in the region near the macroscopic tumor boundary. Compounding the problem, lung cancer patients also "},

A variety of potential sources (Ordovician-Devonian) have been suggested, but still no compelling conclusion has been reached. Silurian stratigraphy in the Appalachian Basin has been hampered by poor or low-resolution stratigraphic correlation and previous attempts to fully evaluate the Silurian Petroleum System (SPS) have been undermined by a paucity of detailed sub-surface stratigraphic data. Recent advances in the correlation of Silurian strata globally, and within North America, indicate that the SPS of the Appalachian Basin likely contains numerous discrete reservoirs that were misidentified and\/or lumped together in previous assessments. Similarly, Silurian paleoceanographic modeling and global event stratigraphy suggest that the Appalachian Basin likely experienced multiple, previously unrecognized, episodes of widespread anoxia\/euxinia. Proposed strongly reducing paleoceanographic conditions in the Appalachian Basin during portions of the Silurian are significant because they could have served to enhance organic carbon burial and increased the potential for petroleum source rock generation. The research proposed herein will produce the first high-resolution evaluation of the Western Appalachian Basin SPS by integrating detailed carbon isotope (13C) chemostratigraphy with conodont and chitinozoan biostratigraphy of Silurian cores and outcrops from Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York.

Briefly treating the explant with high levels of glutamate agonists results in excitotoxic degeneration of inner hair cell (IHC) - type I spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) synapses but does not affect hair cell or SGN viability. The synapses regenerate but the restored innervation is aberrant: the number of synapses is reduced, and individual SGN axons contact multiple IHCs. In all these respects, the in vitro model mimics what has been observed following noise or glutamatergic excitotoxic damage in vivo. Exogenous neurotrophins - BDNF or NT-3 - significantly improve recovery: the number of synapses on IHCs is increased, synapse number is increased, and innervation of multiple IHCs by single axons is reduced. In Aim 1, we quantitatively compare the ability of BDNF and NT-3 to promote regeneration with an extended recovery period and seek to improve our model by extending it to older animals. Our core set of experiments in Aims 2-4 use molecular genetic approaches, including the use of transgenic mice, to test specific hypotheses, suggested by our preliminary data, regarding the function of neurotrophins in recovery and reinnervation of IHCs after excitotoxic trauma.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which overnutrition generates obesity are poorly understood. We hypothesize that overnutrition causes mitochondrial dysfunction by altering NAD metabolism. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a precursor of NAD and supplementation with NR has been shown to reduce weight gain and metabolic dysfunction observed a mouse model of overnutrition. Analysis of the mechanisms whereby NR prevents weight gain may elucidate the molecular mechanisms that cause obesity. This proposal is linked to a parent study of NR supplementation in the context of overnutrition which includes both a mouse model and a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study in adults. The parent study will use mechanistic methods to evaluate the impact of NR supplementation on NAD metabolism in the mouse model. In the human pilot study, the parent study will test the hypothesis that NR supplementation will prevent weight gain. The objective of this K01 proposal is to evaluate alterations in the NAD-targeted and nontargeted metabolome that accompany nicotinamide riboside (NR) supplementation and correlate with metabolomic changes with the results of the mouse mechanistic studies and the human clinical trial. The use of metabolomics in both the mouse and human study provides a unique opportunity to identify novel biomarkers of weight gain and NR supplementation and to link these biomarkers with clinically significant changes in NAD metabolism. The first aim is to evaluate the impact of NR supplementation on the comprehensive NAD metabolome in accessible biological samples. We hypothesize that the NAD metabolome will demonstrate changes associated with increased NAD utilization by SIRT3, a mitochondrial protein deacetylase. We will use NAD-targeted metabolomic analyses of urine, blood and feces to evaluate alterations in NAD metabolism associated with NR supplementation. T"},

Recent advances in developing nano-organized polymer networks based on the self-assembly of amphiphiles, lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs), are of particular interest. Mesogenic surfactants are able to self-organize in presence of water to form LLC mesophases with nano-features. Nanostructured materials based on either polymerizable LLC surfactant or LLC templated monomer mixture have shown great potential as catalyst support, size-selective membranes or tissue engineering scaffolds. However, retaining the geometry of the original template and controlling the structural evolution during polymerization is still challenging, particularly for the non-favorable morphologies. In general, polymerization-induced thermodynamic changes lead to disruption of the original nanostructure. Nevertheless, recent work has shown that structural evolution can be kinetically trapped using rapid reaction rate of photopolymerization. We propose to control kinetics, model and tune thermodynamics to enhance the morphology transfer polymerization in LLC template and ultimately develop a broader range of polymeric material with well-defined nano-features.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIntellectual Merit: The overall goal of the proposed research is therefore to use thermodynamics, photopolymerization kinetics, and surfactant chemistry as tools to understand and direct the structural evolution of polymers formed using LLC media.

This is in sharp contrast to neurological disorders in which neurons die - for example in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease - where neuropathological processes can be clearly assessed as changes in cell morphology. One example of the former class is the movement disorder dystonia. Patients with dystonia suffer from involuntary contractions of muscles in the limbs, hands, feet or neck, and thus from twisting and abnormal posture. Dystonia is highly relevant to Armed Forces personnel and veterans because trauma to the brain and chronic antipsychotic therapy are increasingly recognized as important triggers of dystonia. Clinical studies indicate that dystonia patients experience enhanced neuronal activity in the brain. However, this functional abnormality is still not understood well, and this is holding back the development of effective treatments. The aim of the research proposed here is to identify the functional changes that occur in neurons in the context of dystonia.

Recently, we found that the nose-only viral inoculation could mobilize Ly6C+inflammatory macrophages in the lung parenchyma and increase local inflammatory dendritic cell infiltration without any evidence of viral presence in the lungs. These data suggest that, activation of nasal immune system can prime the lung innate immunity via an indirect mechanism.  Inflammatory reflex is a recently discovered immune regulatory mechanism.  The arc of this reflex consists of the afferent sensory input activated by local infection and cytokines, the central nerve system, and the vagus nerve that carries outbound signals to prime the immune system in the innervated organs.  The nose and lungs are also connected nervously via the naso-bronchial reflex. However, to the best of our knowledge, whether there is inflammatory reflex between the upper and lower airways remains unknown.  In the lungs, studies have shown that many immunocytes, including dendritic cells, eosinophils, T cells, and mast cells reside around the nerve endings, which strongly suggests the regulation of lung immunity by nerves. In this project, we hypothesize that the activation of nasal mucosal immunity can prime the lung innate immunity via inflammatory reflex and subsequently alter the progression of lung diseases. We believe that, the completion of this project is of great significance to understanding the mechanisms by which upper and lower airway interacts"},

A well-studied platform to observe the role of individual genes in shaping neuronal excitability is the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Many mutants with altered excitability have been discovered with lesions in a wide variety of genes, several of their homologs in humans are implicated in epilepsy and other neurological disorders.  In fact, the spectrum of channelopathies associated with a number of voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channel genes in humans is recapitulated in Drosophila with range of recently identified phenotypes. However, unlike vertebrates, all known Nav channels in Drosophila are encoded by a single gene, paralytic (para). The molecular and biophysical properties of many para alleles have been characterized. Taken together, these para alleles present a unique opportunity to determine how different Nav channel properties shape stereotypic spiking activity generated in neural circuits, and interact with excitability environments in a variety of genetic backgrounds. &#x0D;\nTwo striking hyperexcitable phenotypes that have been well described in Drosophila are: anesthetics-induced leg-shaking ('shaking') observed in mutants of several K+ channel genes (e.g. Shaker, Hyperkinetic) and mechanical shock-induced motor activity seen in bang-sensitive mutants (e.g. bang sensitive, easily shocked). I will use a centrally generated stereotypic, spiking patterns as a window to show how perturbations of neuronal excitability affect neuronal circuit function. Paradoxically, bang-sensitive and shaking mutants have opposite effects on excitability in this extensively examined neural circuit in Drosophila. However, one commonality between these categories of mutants is that decreasing voltage gated sodium (Nav) channel density attenuates the phenotype. Specifically, bang-sensitive or shaking mutants show decreased phenoty"},

Tuberculosis is a serious airborne disease for which drug resistance has become a major issue. Particularly problematic is the long treatment time required to cure tuberculosis, since that creates difficulties in maintaining patient adherence to therapy. Sporadic treatment then fosters the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. Non-growing bacteria, present even in active tuberculosis, are thought to contribute significantly to long treatment time, because they are not readily killed by most antimicrobials. Work is proposed to obtain new fluoroquinolones that rapidly kill non-growing M. tuberculosis and thereby radically reduce treatment time. Fluoroquinolones act by trapping DNA gyrase on DNA as ternary drug-enzyme-DNA complexes in which the DNA moiety is broken but constrained by protein. With growing cells, elevated quinolone concentrations lead to chromosome fragmentation and a cascade of reactive oxygen species that rapidy cause death. In contrast, death of non-growing cells requires a distinct processing of ternary complexes such that chromosome fragmentation is observed only with subset of highly active fluoroquinolones, Reactive oxygen species do not account for death of non-growing cells. Understanding the molecular details of chromosome fragmentation in non-growing cells and designing compounds that carry it out more effectively are the goals of the present application. Recent work has led to a novel hypothesis that explains fluoroquinolone-mediated death of non-growing cells. The hypothesis will be tested by designing, synthesizing, and characterizing new quinolones and quinazolinediones.

M. xanthus encodes (at least) 144 histidine kinases (HK) and 150 response regulator (RR) proteins which are predicted to comprise 127 TCS (Muller 2013). However, due to significant sequence similarity for many of the protein sequences, undesired cross talk and bona fide cross regulation between systems is possible. In particular, a subset of TCS comprising 21 NtrB-NtrC homologous pairs in M. xanthus have arisen through duplication events (Goldman 2006) and display even greater sequence similarity than is normally found in other bacteria. Previous genetic analyses have demonstrated that several of the NtrC RR homologs participate in a network affecting development (Giglio 2011). However, our biochemical analyses suggest that each NtrB HK displays a high level of specificity for its cognate RR (Willett 2013). Nevertheless, we have additional, unpublished data indicating a level of cross talk or cross regulation that cannot be explained by current models.

The central hypothesis is that dopamine acts on DopEcR in the context of starvation, counteracting the effects of ecdysone on DopEcR by reducing the strength of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, and that this in turn induces SISS. This hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims: 1) Identify the critical sites of DopEcR action in regulating SISS, and 2) Determine the roles of ecdysone, dopamine and EGFR signaling in DopEcR-mediated SISS. In Aim 1, the research team will identify the endogenous expression pattern of DopEcR and then carry out phenocopy and rescue experiments to identify subsets of neurons that are critical for DopEcR-dependent SISS. In Aim 2, the research team will manipulate ecdysone, dopamine and EGFR signaling using genetic and pharmacological approaches, in the presence or absence of DopEcR mutations, and measure the effects on SISS. Successful completion of this project will reveal the relationships between a non-canonical steroid receptor DopEcR and neuromodulatory signaling pathways in the context of the sleep regulation that occurs upon starvation stress."},

For example, women and men with psychological co-morbidities and those who have a history of lifetime trauma may represent one group of LUTS patients with more complex underlying pathophysiologic processes. To identify factors that may be important to patients but are not captured in currently available questionnaires, we will conduct focus groups in both men and women.

Given the increasing importance of nanoscience and nanotechnology in the future, it is imperative to provide undergraduates with early exposure to research in this emerging, interdisciplinary field in order to enhance their interest in science and engineering as a potential career path. This proposal addresses this need by providing undergraduate students with a unique interdisciplinary research perspective related to nanoscience and nanotechnology. The proposed REU program entitled Undergraduate Research Opportunities in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology at the University of Iowa will run for 10 weeks and will be administered through the Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Institute at the University of Iowa (NNI@UI).  REU undergraduate participants will be provided with on-campus room and board and competitive stipends. Participant Remediation of U and Tc is an extensive challenge because U adsorbs weakly to sediment minerals at pH &lt; 4 (e.g., F-Area) and pH &gt; 8 (e.g., Hanford, INL, and the former Yucca Mt. repository), and Tc has no or little adsorption to common environmental minerals. Although treatment technologies for U contaminants exist and some have been field demonstrated, few of them are effective at the extreme pH systems that are commonly found near the contaminant sources. To address this key knowledge and technology gap for DOE, NRC, and nuclear power utilities, we propose to develop novel and cost-effective magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticles with a magnetic iron oxide core and a surface functionalized by grafting ionic\/nonionic surfactants or chelating agents. The results of this project are expected to be novel and patentable nanomaterials that are cost-effective, tunable, easy to separate and regenerate, and have an exceptionally high capacity and selectivity for U or Tc extraction under broader waste stream conditions (e.g., pH). These results will provide the applied scientific foundation for solving critical DOE and industrial issues related to nuclear environmental stewardship and nuclear power production. Proposed SRS work would start immediately because the literature review is completed, eHAPs are in place, all experimental techniques are developed, and all radionuclides, raw chemicals and specialized equipment are purchased. Finally, the assembled research team has the proven expertise to synthesize and create surface modifications of nanoparticles.&"},

Mouse models that express mutant forms of tau reproduce neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal loss. The pivotal role of tau in neurodegeneration has also been illustrated by the finding that the loss of tau ameliorates deficits in mouse models expressing the amyloid precursor protein. In addition, the loss of Src family non-receptor tyrosine kinase Fyn also decreases the deficits in such models. We are interested in determining if Fyn and tau act together as we have previously shown that tau and Fyn interact, that Fyn phosphorylates tau on tyr18, and that this form of tyrosine phosphorylated tau occurs during Alzheimer's disease. We have also shown that FTDP-17 missense mutations in tau increase its association with Fyn and that phospho-tyr18 tau occurs in a P301L transgenic tau mouse model. Importantly, alterations in Fyn have been reported in AD cases and we have also shown that increased levels of activated Src family tyrosine kinases occur in a P301L transgenic mouse model, suggesting that such kinases have a role in the neurodegenerative process. To investigate the role of Fyn in tauopathies, we propose to examine a transgenic tau mouse model where the Fyn gene has been deleted.

The goals of the U of Iowa MSTP are to recruit outstanding trainees and provide them with the knowledge base, skills, and inspiration to enable their transition to careers as productive and successful physician-scientists. To accomplish these goals, we have developed an integrated curriculum that assimilates scientific and clinical training that continually emphasizes the connections and intersections between science and medicine. Students complete 2 years of pre-clinical medical coursework, 3 to 4 years of graduate training, and approximately 18 months of hospital-based clinical clerkships to fulfill the requirements for both the MD and PhD degrees. The Program incorporates several activities throughout the course of study to provide integration and enrichment of the curriculum, program identity, and mentorship of students during transitions in their training. Enrichment and integration activities include Conversations in Research, MSTP Grand Rounds, Clinical Connections, Directors' Dinners, and an annual MSTP Retreat and Poster Session. The Program is associated with 151 talented and diverse faculty members who provide exciting research training opportunities for our students. Students are extensively involved in the MSTP administration, holding positions on the Executive, Admissions, and Recruitment Committees. The Program enjoys strong institutional support from the Dean of the Carver College of Medicine, who understands the importance of MSTP training in academic medical centers.

This noncompeting continuation report focuses on the next year (Year 5) of the 5-year HRSA training grant to enhance DPH training for dental students at the University of Iowa College of Dentistry.  During Year 5 of the grant, the main emphases will be the continued implementation of the curriculum and sequences, ongoing student involvement\/learning, recruitment of the next year's students, and seminars, classes, and conferences, including conducting the annual regional DPH conference.  The program will include delivery of current courses from the post-doctoral MS in DPH degree program, with special scheduling consideration for the dental students. New seminars will be conducted for these trainees, and they also will attend currently existing program seminars. One invited guest lecturer will come to teach each semester. New graduated outreach service learning experiences will be continued and developed further for the D-1 and D-2 years, and D-4 extramurals will be enhanced. Trainees also will attend our regional DPH annual conference and receive support to attend the National Oral Health Conference.

A century after theories identified the prominent roles of sugars in dental caries etiology and the discovery of the beneficial effects of fluorides, caries remains a highly prevalent disease throughout childhood, including adolescence.  Adolescents' greater independence and frequent exposure to sugared beverages (e.g., soda pop) appear to place them at greater risk than at younger ages.  However, these caries incidence patterns and relationships with risk factors are poorly understood because there are few studies of caries incidence or risk factors among adolescent subjects.  Since 1991, using a cohort recruited at birth, the ongoing Iowa Fluoride Study (IFS) has comprehensively assessed the relationships between dietary data and fluoride exposures and dental caries in individuals at ages 5, 9, and 13.  As caries continues to be a significant disease in adolescents, the proposed study provides a unique opportunity to assess the effects of socio-demographic, dietary, fluoride, and other factors on the incidence of dental caries during adolescence from age 13 to 17 years in our cohort. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n The main objectives of this proposal are to 1) conduct detailed secondary analyses of patterns of dental caries of the permanent dentition at age 17 and caries incidence from 13 to 17, and 2) comprehensively examine the relationships among dental caries incidence from age 13 to 17 (and age 17 prevalence) and dietary, fluoride, prior caries experience, and socio-demographic factors.  Multivariable analyses will assess the relationships between and interactions among caries outcomes (incidence\/increments and prevalence\/counts) and longitudinally-collected data on various dietary patterns, oral health behaviors, fluoride exposures, previous caries experience, socio-demographics, and other factors.  We will then assess the consistency of our findings concerning caries risk factors for ages 13 to 17 with those from analyses of caries risk factors during earlier periods from ages 5 to "},

J. Margulis, U. Iowa; co-PI: E. W. Castner, Jr., Rutgers&#x0D;\nIonic liquids (ILs) are now being used in a number of industrial processes, including in the production of nylon-6. Uses of ILs for which patents have been filed include improved lithium batteries and supercapacitors and purification of crude oil using ILs for desulfurization and denitrification. The most used ionic liquids have an alkyl chain tethered to either the cation, the anion or both. Recent work combining molecular simulation and X-ray scattering experi- ments, including our contributions from the current NSF grant period, elucidates how we can understand the structure of ionic liquids having alkyl tails. We have shown that to understand the structure on different length scales ranging from the atomic level to about 3 nm, it is important to consider three different kinds of correlations between the ions. On the short- est length scales, nearest neighbor and intramolecular correlations dominate, at intermediate length scales Coulombic interactions give rise to charge alternation. Nanometer range order is seen to arise from strong correlations and anti-correlations of polar (cation and anion head groups) with non-polar alkyl tails. We propose to extend our exploration of the vast space of potential ionic liquids beyond the \"polar heads and apolar tails\" paradigm by again combining experimental X-ray scattering with molecular simulations on novel IL systems of low viscosity; we expect to modulate the intermediate range order.&#x0D;\nIntellectual Merit of the Proposal: We will expand on prior work beyond the established paradigm in two significant ways.

Dr. Torner is a nationally recognized expert in health systems evaluation and an investigator with decades of experience in developing and evaluating the trauma and stroke systems in Iowa. The specific aims of the proposed study are (1) to compare inter-hospital transfer practices for rural and urban patients with sepsis, (2) to determine the effect of inter-hospital transfer on survival among patients who present to non-tertiary EDs, and (3) to measure the cost impact of inter-hospital transfer for rural patients with sepsis.  To achieve our specific aims, we will integrate data from the Iowa Hospital Association Inpatient and Outpatient data sets with data from the Iowa Emergency Medical Services Patient Registry to develop a comprehensive data set of sepsis patient care in Iowa from 2009-2013. This data set will include d"},

Although it is part of the normal flora of healthy individuals, S. epidermidis is responsible for a significant portion of healthcare-associated infections (HAI). It is the number one cause of pacemaker infections and central line-associated bloodstream infections, and the number two cause of surgical site infections. A major S. epidermidis virulence determinant is its ability to form a biofilm on medical implant material. Although the polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) has been well-studied as a critical mediator of S. epidermidis biofilm development, a number of studies show that 30-50% of S. epidermidis clinical isolates do not produce PIA. In PIA-negative strains, a cell surface-bound adhesin called Aap (accumulation-associated protein) is required for biofilm formation. To promote biofilm development, Aap must be proteolytically processed, but the mechanism employed by S. epidermidis to process Aap and facilitate PIA-independent biofilm formation is not clear. Our preliminary work suggests that secreted proteases are critical for Aap-dependent biofilm development. We hypothesize that the S. epidermidis secreted proteases Ecp, SepA, and Esp are required to process Aap and induce PIA-independent biofilm formation. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims:&#x0D;\nSpecific Aim 1: Characterize the genetic regulation of S. epidermidis secreted proteases.&#x0D;\nSpecific Aim 2: Identify the roles of S. epidermidis secreted proteases in PIA-independent biofilm formation.&#x0D;\nTo achieve these aims, we will employ genetic and biochemical methods.

Compared to the larger particles present in samples collected with typical industrial hygiene samplers (e.g., respirable), nanoparticles have substantially greater biological reactivity, deposition in the respiratory tract, and mobility in the body after depositing. Thus, freshly produced nanoparticles near fume sources may drive much of the observed adverse health effects, and respirable sampling may be insufficient to assess metal-based exposure risks. We have recently developed a novel personal sampler-the nanoparticle respiratory dose (NRD) sampler-and an associated analytical method that is easy to use, is inexpensive to analyze, and integrates into current personal exposure sampling strategies that can streamline the multi-step process for assessing titanium dioxide nanoparticle exposures. The work outlined in this application will expand the applicability of the NRD sampler and associated analytical methods to dramatically improve exposure assessment of a broad range of metal-based nanoparticle exposures in the workplace. With successful completion of the work proposed here, there will be many benefits, including an innovative, new sampler (Aim 1) coupled with associated analytical methods (Aim 2) applicable to assessing exposures to airborne metal-based particles. These new methodologies, validated through field studies (Aim 3), will be available for exposure assessments in routine industrial hygiene practice and in epidemiological study to better elucidate the adverse health effects that may be associated specifically with certain metal-based nanoparticle exposures. Consequently, our methods will have widespread use to assess exposures in the burgeoning field of nanotechnology or in more traditional occupational settings such as where welding occurs."},

Over 90% of all colorectal tumors contain mutations that result in defects in a conserved cell communication pathway, called the Wnt pathway. The mammalian intestine uses the Wnt pathway to regulate the differentiation and asymmetric division of intestinal stem cells, however visualizing these stem cells is technically very difficult and is limited to analyses of fixed tissue. We propose to study Wnt pathway control of asymmetric stem cell division using the more experimentally amenable nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans is a powerful and widely used experimental model animal that utilizes Wnt signaling in its hypodermal stem cell divisions. Importantly, visualization of these stem cell divisions is routine in living animals. The results of the proposed research are biomedically relevant because they are expected provide new insights into activation of the conserved Wnt cell signaling pathways and how it controls asymmetric cell division during human development and tumor formation. There is the promise that the results of the proposed studies will contribute to a strong scientific framework for the future development of new drugs targeting Wnt signaling components during defective asymmetric division in human disease. We will test specific hypotheses regarding stem cell biology and analyze the results during real time asymmetric divisions, which will uncover novel mechanisms of Wnt signaling in stem cells that would remain unclear without the analysis of C. elegans Wnt signaling."},

Given that the number of adults &gt;65 years of age in the U.S. will double to almost 70 million by 2030, future CVD-related illness in older adults remains a major public health concern. The increased risk of CVD in older adults has been attributed in large part to three fundamental alterations in cardiovascular structure and function associated with normal aging: stiffening of the large elastic central arteries (e.g., aorta), reduction in vascular endothelial function, and decreased cardiac left ventricular (LV) diastolic function. The mechanisms responsible for these physiological changes with aging are not completely understood, but strong evidence suggests that inflammation and oxidative stress may be common mechanistic links between them. Our central working hypothesis is that chronic vascular inflammation plays a central role in the development of CVD with aging, through an oxidative stress-mediated deterioration in cardiovascular function. The broad, long-term objective of this project is to determine whether chronic inhibition of inflammation with salsalate (8 weeks; 3-4 g\/day), a non-acetylated salicylate commonly used clinically to treat chronic inflammatory diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), is effective in improving or restoring impaired cardiovascular function in older adults through an oxidative stress-dependent mechanism. In a group of older adults (age 60-79 years) without CVD, we will test the following three specific aims in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, pilot study: Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that chronic inhibition of inflammation will improve aortic wall stiffness (carotid-femoral artery pulse wave velocity; proximal aortic characteristic impedance); Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that chronic inhibition of inflammation will improve vascular endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated endothelium-dep"},

Since current treatments provide meaningful improvement to only 50% of patients, there is a need to identify new pharmacological targets to develop alternative treatments. Early stages of DR are determined by endothelial dysfunction due to increased retinal oxidative stress, resulting in increased vascular permeability. The subsequent distortion of the retinal architecture leads to loss of vision.&#x0D;\nThe multifunctional Ca2+\/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is widely expressed in the vascular endothelium. Previous in vitro data with an imperfect inhibitor indicate that it may play a central role in the regulation of the endothelial permeability, possibly through actin cytoskeleton remodeling. However, the use of inhibitors with known CaMKII-independent effects and the lack of an in vivo model of CaMKII inhibition in retinal endothelium have impeded our progress towards understanding the physiological relevance of endothelial CaMKII. &#x0D;\nOur preliminary data show that specific CaMKII inhibition limited to endothelium in a transgenic model prevents retinal vascular leakage in type 1 diabetes. In eyes from human donors with diabetes, we detected an increase in active oxidized CaMKII in the endothelium of the retinal vessels. These data correlate with our in vitro findings that hyperglycemia increases the presence of oxidized CaMKII in cultured retinal endothelial cells. Further data demonstrate that CaMKII inhibition decreases stress fiber formation under hyperglycemia. &#x0D;\nBased on our preliminary results, we propose that increased vascular permeability in vivo is dependent upon CaMKII activation through reactive oxygen species. Moreover, we propose that active CaMKII induces RhoA\/ROCK activation and subsequent actin stress fiber formation, which causes endothelium contraction and increases vascular permeability.&#x0D;\nAfter i"},

For soluble proteins, the burial of hydrophobic groups away from  aqueous interfaces is a major driving force, but membrane-embedded proteins cannot experience hydrophobic forces, as the lipid bilayer lacks water. A fundamental conundrum thus arises: how does a greasy protein surface find its greasy protein partner in the greasy lipid bilayer to fold faithfully into its native structure? Recently, a structurally stable and functional monomeric form of the normally homodimeric Cl-\/H+ antiporter CLC-ec1 was designed by introducing tryptophan mutations at the dimer interface. Preliminary studies show that the protein can be shifted back to the dimer state with additional mutations or in certain lipid conditions. These results present CLC-ec1 as a model to study reversible dimerization in a membrane enviroment. To make these energetic measurements, monomer and dimers will be identified with single molecule resolution using total internal fluorescence microscopy (TIRF) by examining photo-bleaching and Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) characterizing the dimer state.  With these assays in place, experiments will be carried out to investigate two alternative hypotheses that have pervaded discourse in this field. First, that transmembrane interactions are enthalpy-driven by van der Waals forces at highly complementary surfaces. Changes in free energy will be measured upon substitution of interface residues to alanine or tryptophan, with significant positions studied further by increasing side- chain volume to modulate the van der Waals interactions. The second hypothesis is that dimerization is driven by increased entropy of lipids upon helix association. To study this, the molecules forming the lipid solvent will be modified by changing the chemical head group, chain length and chain order using unsaturated or t"},

The overall objective of this project is to identify mechanisms by which CGRP triggers photophobia, a common symptom of migraine. Photophobia is a painful response to ordinarily non-painful levels of light. A useful tool for these studies is the nestin\/hRAMP1 transgenic mouse, which is sensitized to CGRP actions. The mice have elevated nervous system expression of a subunit of the CGRP receptor called human receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (hRAMP1). Nestin\/hRAMP1 mice have heightened responses to at least two sensory stimuli: touch and light. The light aversive phenotype is analogous to photophobia and is greatly enhanced by central administration of CGRP. The mice also display enhanced light aversive behavior following chemically induced mast cell degranulation and a mild stress paradigm. Stress is one of the most common triggers of migraine and also induces dural mast cell degranulation. There is evidence that migraine is a neural disorder that can be exacerbated by inflammatory signals: dural mast cells activate trigeminal nociceptive pathways, mast cell degranulation triggers migraine-like headaches, and anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used for migraine. We hypothesize that CGRP can act in the thalamus to trigger light aversion following stress-induced neurogenic inflammation. This hypothesis is based on a recent finding that posterior thalamic neurons are sensitive to both dural and light stimulation. Furthermore, CGRP can activate dural mast cells, trigeminal neurons, and posterior thalamic neurons. Thus, there is a CGRP-dependent pathway for stress-induced mast cell activation to sensitize thalamic neurons to light, leading to photophobia. The first aim will establish the contribution of mast cells in light aversive behavior.

Our long-term goal is to understand the&#x0D;\nepigenetic mechanisms involved in stem cell fate choice, using the development of&#x0D;\nhematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as our model. Since&#x0D;\nHSCs can be derived in vitro by directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs),&#x0D;\nthis procedure holds great promise for cell-based therapy of hematological disorders.&#x0D;\nHowever, compared to later stages of HSC differentiation that give rise to various blood&#x0D;\ncell lineages, epigenetic mechanisms controlling HSC fate specification from ESCs are&#x0D;\npoorly understood, impeding efforts to develop an efficient protocol for in vitro derivation&#x0D;\nof HSCs.

This application seeks to obtain a systems-level&#x0D;\nunderstanding of epigenetic regulation of HSC fate by coupling wet-lab experiments with&#x0D;\ncomputational modeling.

In pursuit of this the PIs set objectives to address by systematically combining: a) the theory of extreme value statistics, b) asymptotic analysis in probability, c) stochastic optimization, and d) highly efficient Monte Carlo techniques. Specific objectives include: 1) Establishing a robust asymptotic theory to account for tail events uniformly over a wide range of settings. 2) Taking advantage of the asymptotic theory to build provably efficient Monte Carlo estimators for rare events in corresponding settings. 3) Investigation of a robust approach that accounts for model misspecification.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIntellectual Merit:  The PIs propose a comprehensive risk analysis of extreme events by encompassing areas 1) to 3) indicated earlier. This approach is both innovative and necessary because the nature of rare events exposes deficiencies in each of these areas. i) The theory of extreme value statistics must assume a large number of data points to provide accurate estimators but the nature of rare events precludes this assumption. ii) Asymptotic analysis techniques allow to obtain formulas that are easily evaluated and thus amenable to sensitivity analysis under a wide range of model parameters. So, asymptotics may help mitigate some of the statistical error issue. Unfortunately, asymptotic formulas carry an unmeasurable error and often lose important information. iii) Efficient Monte Carlo has a controlled error and one can evaluate conditional expectations given the event of interest, but it still assumes a model in place and could lead to incorrect conclusions in case the model is incorrect. iv) Optimization techniques might help mitigate the problem of model uncertainty by computing bounds for the probabilities of interest, optimizing over the selection of models that cover the truth with high confidence.

This necessitates the need for multiple surgical interventions and may cause significant patient&#x0D;\nmorbidity. Hence, there is compelling need to develop therapies to improve the bone healing course. This is especially&#x0D;\nimportant in patients with impaired bone healing such as diabetics. As of 2010, 25.8 million people (8.3% of the US&#x0D;\npopulation) have diabetes; 1.9 million new cases of diabetes were diagnosed in people aged 20 years or older in 2010&#x0D;\nand these numbers are expected to increase. Recent evidence suggests anabolic influence of macrophages during&#x0D;\nbone healing in fracture models. Alexander et al demonstrated that depletion of macrophages in Mafia transgenic mice&#x0D;\nis associated with significantly suppressed collagen Type I bone matrix deposition and mineralization during bone&#x0D;\nhealing in vivo in tibia fracture model. The dynamic changes in the presence of polarized macrophages with&#x0D;\npro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) properties may affect the early healing process. Monocytes from&#x0D;\nobese type 2 diabetics have lower levels of IL-10 and CD163 expression compared with non-diabetics suggestive of&#x0D;\ndecreased M2 macrophage markers. A recent whole genome microarray of implant adherent cells in a human&#x0D;\nosseointegration model identified upregulation of several genes related to acquisition of M2 properties in the early&#x0D;\nhealing phase (day3 ?7), which implicates a potential role of these cells in achieving bone-implant integration.&#x0D;\nElucidation of the role of M2 macrophage in bone regeneration is essential for our understanding of bone healing and&#x0D;\nalso advance strategies to accelerate bone repair. In this proposal, we hypothesize that obese (BMI&gt;30) type II&#x0D;\ndiabetics have impaired M2 macrophage polarization at the initial phase of bone regeneration.

Current treatment for these conditions relies largely on transfusion of red blood cells and platelets-therapies that remain controversial and incompletely investigated. Prior research by our PPG group and others has established that many aspects of the pathophysiology of the anemia and thrombocytopenia of prematurity are unique. However, our understanding is incomplete. Hence, the goals of our renewal are to further define the mechanisms that give rise to these pressing and related clinical conditions, to optimize their treatment per such mechanistic knowledge, and consequently, to reduce both short- and long-term disabilities associated with these conditions. Our 4 interrelated projects, whose objectives are directly relevant to our unifying theme, include: Project 1 \"Optimized erythropoietin treatment of neonatal anemia,\" PL JA Widness (and P Veng-Pedersen); Project 2 \"Pathogenesis and treatment of neonatal thrombocytopenia,\" PL M Sola-Visner; Project 3 \"Preterm transfusions: brain structure\/function outcomes,\" PL PC Nopoulos; and Project 4 \"The role of neonatal anemia in learning and memory,\" PL MK Georgieff. Core A (\"Administrative, statistical, and research personnel\") and Core B (\"Laboratory and database,\" PL DM Mock) will provide support for all projects. To enhance effectiveness, our program has expanded to involve four (vs. two) performance sites, so that data can be shared among Projects 1, 2 and 3 (i.e. data from the same infants will be used in studies at multiple sites). Our history of success conducting multisite research will be invaluable in coordinating studies across the various performance sites.

Research, particularly on cancer of the breast, has made great strides in curtailment of disease with chemical and radiation therapy; however, these procedures have resulted in minimum success for chondrosarcomas and no general standard of care has emerged.  New treatment options must to be identified to improve patient outcomes and decrease mortality associated with disease.  For the most aggressive chondrosarcoma tumor, a grade IV, metastasis to the lung results in death in 80% of patients within 5 years of diagnosis.  Here we propose to make quaternary ammonium analogues of novel chemotherapeutics for targeting the cartilaginous matrix of chondrosarcoma.  Our preliminary results indicate that our novel chemotherapeutic has highly potent activity against chondrosarcoma cells in animal models.  In this phase I STTR application Terpenoid Therapeutics and our partners at the University of Iowa seek to show feasibility of treating this disease.  Specifically, we propose two aims to accomplish this goal: 1) synthesize two novel quaternary ammonium analogues of our highly potent anti-cancer agents; and 2) test them in cell culture and animal models of chondrosarcoma.  We believe that this strategy has a high likelihood of success in advancing a novel agent to the clinic for this orphan disease. This represents a non-competitive renewal of the funded NIH grant listed above, which began on January 1st, 2013.

Of those who could benefit from hearing aid amplification, less than one in ten with mild hearing loss and less than four in ten with moderate-to-severe hearing loss acquire and use hearing aids. One of the most often reported reasons that people do not seek intervention is hearing aids' high cost. Currently a variety of low-cost hearing aids equipped with relatively low-end technologies are available on the market. Thus, it is important to examine if hearing-impaired elderly adults, who typically have fewer communication demands than younger listeners, need expensive high-end technologies to attain optimal hearing aid benefits. The first aim of this research is to investigate the relationship between technology level and the real-world effectiveness of hearing aids in elderly adults with bilateral mild to moderate hearing loss, focusing on directional microphone and digital noise reduction technologies. &#x0D;\nBecause (1) the effects of these two hearing technologies are highly dependent on the listening situation and (2) elderly listeners are less able to clearly remember the situational-dependent effect during month-long field trials, we will employ a real-world outcome measure system that has sufficient situational resolution and is not subject to memory bias to assess real-world hearing aid effectiveness. The system consists of (1) a subjective Ecological Momentary Assessment, which involves repeated sampling of listeners' perception in real time and in natural environments using modern wireless smartphones and the Internet, and (2) an objective, automated system that could characterize and model the listeners' natural communication behaviors and environments by analyzing the audio recordings made during the listeners' daily activities.

Adult T-cell leukemia\/lymphoma (ATL) may arise from 2-5% of the 15-20&#x0D;\nmillion people world-wide who are infected with human T-lymphotropic virus type I. Malignant transformation&#x0D;\nof developing thymocytes or mature T cells is caused by multistep mutagenesis involving various genetic&#x0D;\nalterations. Mutations leading to constitutive activation of morphogenic Wnt signaling pathway are&#x0D;\nfrequently associated with cancers in multiple tissues including T lineage cells. The canonical Wnt&#x0D;\nsignaling pathway acts through a transcription factor named T cell factor 1 (TCF-1), which is required for&#x0D;\nnormal thymocyte development and maturation. During our studies on regulation of mature T cell responses by&#x0D;\nWnt\/TCF-1 pathway, we made a surprising finding that TCF-1-deficient mice developed aggressive immature T&#x0D;\ncell lymphomas after bacterial or viral infection. These observations suggest at least two interesting&#x0D;\naspects in oncogenesis of T lineage cells. First, although overly active Wnt signaling is oncogenic, TCF-1&#x0D;\ndeficiency hence diminished Wnt signaling can also lead to malignant transformation. Second,&#x0D;\ninfection\/inflammation-derived signals may have tumor-promoting effect in individuals with certain genetic&#x0D;\ndefects (TCF-1 deficiency in this case).
