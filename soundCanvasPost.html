        <h1 class='center'>Sound Canvas</h1>
        <p class="lead center">A visualization of sound as a measure of engagement.</p>

        <p>So here's the story:</p>
        <p>I went to the <a href='http://obermann.uiowa.edu/'>University of Iowa Obermann Center</a> working symposium
        <a href='http://designingthedigitalfuture.com/'>Designing the Digital Future</a> and it was pretty awe inspiring.</p>
        <p>I was surrounded by many great thinkers doing some great things.</p>
        <p>The symposium was kicked off by <a href='http://hci.uncc.edu/~clatulip/clwp/'>Celine Latulipe</a>
            from the <a href='http://hci.uncc.edu/'>Human Computer Interaction Lab at UNC Charlotte</a>.  While I really enjoyed the talk,
        one of interesting asides was related to her work on Sound Interaction.</p>
        <p>When she started the talk, she opened up what I'll call a sound-reactive canvas.  As the audience made noise by asking questions,
        laughing, clapping, or otherwise sharing their engagement audibly, the application painted dots across the screen.  At the end
        of her talk she showed us what our engagement over the talk looked like.</p>
        <p>This small, but significant, part of the symposium was something that I latched onto and decided to work with.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>This is what I ended up with:</p>
        <div class='container-fluid'>
            <div class='row'>
                <div class='col-md-4'><img src='images/sleepyScaled.png' width="200px" alt='engagement image from Sleepy Hollow season 2, episode 8.'/></div>
                <div class='col-md-4'><img src='images/sleepyNoScaled.png' width="200px" alt='engagement image from Sleepy Hollow season 2, episode 8. without scaled thumbnails'/></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <hr />
        <p>These are visualizations captured while we watched "Heartless" the 8th episode of Sleepy Hollow season 2.</p>
        <p>But this wounldn't be a technical post without a discussion of how I got there.</p>
        <p>You can skip ahead by visiting <a href='soundCanvasNoScaled.html'>the SoundCanvas</a> and playing with the demo.</p>
        <p>You can also play with the code by forking this <a href='https://www.github.com/jjimenez/jjimenez.github.io'>github project</a>
            or play with the <a href='http://jsfiddle.net/jose_jimenez/6w2sncvq/'>jsfiddle</a> in your browser.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class='lead center'>First step</p>
        <p>The first step is actually deciding to do things, so I'll share one quick thing.  I wanted to do, and did, most of this
        work with my 10 year old daughter helping me explore code and even taking over the keyboard a couple of times.
        We explored artistic sensibilities of the project together too.</p>
        <p class='lead center'>Finding a place to start</p>
        <p>I wanted to take advantage of some of the things I've done recently with <a href='http://d3js.org/'>D3</a>,
            but I couldn't really
        justify using svg and the full d3 framework when I thought I might be able to do this in a simpler way.  With
            <a href='http://www.amazon.com/echo'>Amazon's Echo</a>
        just out, we had been playing with google now in chrome earlier in the day, so I know we could take advantage
        of browser microphone input.  I just didn't know how.</p>
        <p>We did some exploring and eventually found an example of how to use the microphone input on
            <a href='http://apprentice.craic.com/tutorials/36'>Web Apprentice</a>.</p>
        <p>It is a pretty good explanation of the code necessary to request access to the microphone and start using the input.</p>
        <p>Take a minute to visit that site, check out the code and come back here when you are ready.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Here is some of the code we changed:</p>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>
  function drawTimeDomain() {
    var minValue = 9999999;
    var maxValue = 0;

    for (var i = 0; i < amplitudeArray.length; i++) {
        var value = amplitudeArray[i] / 256;
        if(value > maxValue) {
            maxValue = value;
        } else if(value < minValue) {
            minValue = value;
        }
    }

    var y_lo = canvasHeight - (canvasHeight * minValue) - 1;
    var y_hi = canvasHeight - (canvasHeight * maxValue) - 1;

    ctx.fillStyle = '#ffffff';
    ctx.fillRect(column,y_lo, 1, y_hi - y_lo);

    // loop around the canvas when we reach the end
    column += 1;
    if(column >= canvasWidth) {
        column = 0;
        clearCanvas();
    }
  }
        </pre>
        <p>What it does on the Web Apprentice tutorial is draw thin lines from the maximum amplitude (y_hi) to the
        minimum amplitude (y_lo) scaled to the output canvas for each time slice of the microphone input resulting
            in a pretty standard looking waveform analysis.  Pretty slick. </p>
        <hr/>
        <p class='lead center'>But we want circles!</p>
        <p>Here is our version of the same method.</p>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>
function drawTimeDomain() {

    ctx.fillStyle = config.randomColor();

    var centerX = column + config.wobble();
    var centerY = row + config.wobble();
    var radius = config.radiusFromAmplitudeArray(amplitudeArray);

    //draw a circle on the canvas grid including the wobble
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.arc(centerX, centerY, radius, 0, 2 * Math.PI, false);
    ctx.fill();

    // loop around the canvas when we reach the end
    column += config.gridStep;
    if (column >= config.canvasWidth) {
        column = 30;
        row += config.gridStep;
        if (row >= config.canvasHeight) {
            if (config.addScaled)
                redraw();
            column = redrawColumn;
            row = redrawRow;
        }

    }
}
        </pre>
        <p>You'll notice that it is quite a bit different, so we'll go through a couple of lines of code.</p>

        <pre class='prettyprint'>
            ctx.fillStyle = config.randomColor();
        </pre>
        <p>This generates a random color by using the <a href='http://www.paulirish.com/2009/random-hex-color-code-snippets/'>
            power of the internets</a> and a config object setup at the top of the code which defines randomColor as:</p>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>
randomColor: function () {
        return '#' + Math.floor(Math.random() * 16777215).toString(16);
    }
        </pre>
        <p>Go read the post linked above for an explanation.</p>
        <p>We continue to define the position for the center of the circles based on a loop around a grid of the
        canvas that sets the column and row to position the next circle.  If we left it at that, we would end up
        with perfectly overlapping centers for circles.  Here comes the artistry that is defined in the config object as:</p>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>
wobble: function () {
        return Math.floor(Math.random() * config.wobbleFactor) - Math.floor(config.wobbleFactor / 2);
    }
        </pre>
        <p>Randomness for the win!  We subtract half of the wobble factor to allow for negative numbers.
            This allows the center of the circle to move up and down, left or right of the
        grid position on the canvas.</p>
        <p>The wobbleFactor is just a number.  We set it to 50 after playing with it for a while.</p>
        <hr />
        <p class='lead center'>What about the size of the circles you ask?</p>
        <p>The code:</p>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>
var radius = config.radiusFromAmplitudeArray(amplitudeArray);
        </pre>
        <p>Takes care of that, so, don't worry about it.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p class='lead center'>I worry about the size enough for all of us.</p>
        <p>This was actually one of the harder parts.  Initially my daughter and I just used a simple formula for the
        radius which used the y_hi and scaled it to fit.  It was simple, elegant even....  And then, true confessions
            of a dead-beat dad, I broke it by
        trying to make it better.  I hadn't kicked up git yet, so I was out of luck to put it back.  So I had to
        re-engineer it.  I'm trying to live that one down.</p>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>
radiusFromAmplitudeArray: function (amplitudeArray) {
        var max = 0;
        var min = 99999;
        for (var i = 0; i < amplitudeArray.length; i++) {
            max = max < amplitudeArray[i] ? amplitudeArray[i] : max;
            min = min > amplitudeArray[i] ? amplitudeArray[i] : min;
        }

        var diff = Math.abs(max - min);
        var radius = config.scaleRadius(diff);

        //console.log ("min: " + min + " max: " + max + " diff: " + diff +  " radius: " + radius);
        return Math.abs(radius);
    }
        </pre>
        <p>Similar to the original code we get the max and the min for the amplitude.  We don't scale it by
        dividing by 256 like the original code.  We get the difference between the two and then we scale it using
        Math.  Notice the capital M.  It is important.  ScaleRadius is defined as:</p>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>
scaler: function () {
        return config.circleRange() / config.amplitudeRange();
    },
scaleRadius: function (r) {
        return config.scaler() * (r - config.amplitudeMin) + config.circleMin;
    }
        </pre>
        <p>The circleRange is the difference between the maximum and minimum circle size we want and the
        amplitudeRange is the minumum and maximum range we expect to get. </p>
        <p>If you want to know how that formula works, we found a good
            <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5294955/how-to-scale-down-a-range-of-numbers-with-a-known-min-and-max-value'>
                Math StackOverflow</a>. Think back to how you learned to scale temperature scales of Celsius and Fahrenheit.
            Same thing.
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p class='lead center'>A final note</p>
        <p>I like working with my daughter on coding projects.  We've done a few together for a few years now.
        One thing we like to do is to take all the numbers in a piece of unfamiliar code and tinker with them so we can
        identify what they do when we run the code again.  We extend that to web colors too.  Once we figure them out
        we create variables for them and move them up to a central portion of the code.  Recently, I've started making
        config objects to hold the variables so you'll see that in our version of the code.  It also happens
            to make the code easier to tinker with again.</p>
        <p>Here is the complete config object for this piece of code:</p>
        <pre class='prettyprint'>
var config = {
    sampleSize: 4096 * .25,       // number of samples to collect before analyzing
    // decreasing this gives a faster sonogram, increasing it slows it down
    gridStep: 50,          // canvas grid x and y steps
    canvasWidth: 1000,      // needs to be in lockstep with css value at the time the canvas object is created

    canvasHeight: 700,     //     otherwise the circles are scaled strangely
    wobbleFactor: 50,      // moves the center of the circles within a random orbit around the grid points of the canvas
    circleMax: 100,        // maximum size of a circle
    circleMin: 1,          // minimum size of a circle
    amplitudeMax: 300,     // what the maximum amplitude might be
    amplitudeMin: 0.0,     // what the minimum amplitude might be
    transparency: 0.75,   // the transparency of the circles
    addScaled: false,     // copy the scaled image to the top corner for each cycle.
    // functions to calculate various things below including the wobble of the positioning of the circles,
    //  the radius of the circles
    // and the color of the circles.
    wobble: function () {
        return Math.floor(Math.random() * config.wobbleFactor) - Math.floor(config.wobbleFactor / 2);
    },
    amplitudeRange: function () {
        return config.amplitudeMax - config.amplitudeMin;
    },
    circleRange: function () {
        return config.circleMax - config.circleMin;
    },
    scaler: function () {
        return config.circleRange() / config.amplitudeRange();
    },
    radiusFromAmplitudeArray: function (amplitudeArray) {
        var max = 0;
        var min = 99999;
        for (var i = 0; i < amplitudeArray.length; i++) {
            max = max < amplitudeArray[i] ? amplitudeArray[i] : max;
            min = min > amplitudeArray[i] ? amplitudeArray[i] : min;
        }

        var diff = Math.abs(max - min);
        var radius = config.scaleRadius(diff);

        //console.log ("min: " + min + " max: " + max + " diff: " + diff +  " radius: " + radius);
        return Math.abs(radius);
    },
    scaleRadius: function (r) {
        return config.scaler() * (r - config.amplitudeMin) + config.circleMin;
    },
    randomColor: function () {
        return '#' + Math.floor(Math.random() * 16777215).toString(16);
    }
}
        </pre>
